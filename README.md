# Journal peer reviewer Templates

**Author:** [Yannis Galanakis](https://www.yannisgalanakis.com); <galanakis.gian@gmail.com>

This template helps to act a reviewer in a peer-reviewed journal. You can create in `R` Markdown the cover letter to the Editor and the reviewer report. The templates are based on [Yannis Galanakis' Data Analysis Template](https://github.com/ygalanak/DataAnalysisTemplate). From these templates, you may export your `.Rmd` file into `.tex`, hence `.pdf`. An `.html` option would be available but not used for peer-reviewing activities.

# Cover letter
It uses its own template and generates a letter. The letter can be used further to apply for a grant or any other purpose.

To use, simply replace the sender and recipient information, subject and content. Once happy with the content, you may "Knit" it.

# Report
It uses its own template and generates a `.pdf` report. The report may include references. They are presented using the [`econ.bst`](https://github.com/ShiroTakeda/econ-bst). For illustration purposes, I include a graph generated in the `.Rmd` and included.

To use, simply replace the articles details. Review and knit.

# Before refereeing 
Many resources on how to be a good referee are available. A suggestion regards [Berk, J., Harvey, C. R., & Hirshleifer, D. A. (2016). Preparing a Referee Report: Guidelines and Perspectives.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2547191)
