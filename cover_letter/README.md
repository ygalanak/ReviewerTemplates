# Cover letter
Easily write letters to the Editor, to respond to a referee or apply for a job/grant.

# Usage
Create your letter by following the template provided by the example letter `coverletter.Rmd`. You can change your signature by changing the `signature.pdf` files. Once you have your markdown letter the way you like it, go ahead and "Knit" it.

See the final (example) product [here]().

# Dependencies
This tool is pretty light on dependencies. All you need is to have Pandoc running on your computer. Don't yet have Pandoc? Follow the installation instructions [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).
